# Signal — Iteration 1: Contrib Prep → Review

Champion: @mellanon
Period: Feb 3–14, 2026
Goal: Extract Signal from trunk, get first community review

## Contrib Prep

- [ ] 🏃 Create CONTRIBUTION-REGISTRY.md (file inventory)
- [ ] Run sanitization scan (PII, secrets, personal paths)
- [ ] Tag tested code: `signal-v1.0.0`
- [ ] Cherry-pick inventory files to clean contrib branch
- [ ] Verify: diff review, no excluded files, tests pass

## Review

- [ ] Push contrib branch to public fork
- [ ] 💪 First cross-agent review (seeking: @jcfischer or community volunteer)
- [ ] Fix review findings, re-tag if needed

## Release

- [ ] ⬛ Package PR (deferred to Iteration 2 if review incomplete)
